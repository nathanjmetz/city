# Team status (start here)

Updated 2026-10-25 by the coordinating session ("Desktop photoreal handoff"). This file is the state, not a diary: rewrite it at each stop.

## Standing orders from Nathan (2026-10-25)

- "i want you to begin the work and continue without asking me anything. i wont be here to approve so i dont want you to stop."
- Merge to main when each step is verified, meaning every web-preview test passes and a second reviewer has checked the diff. Then confirm the web and desktop builds finish before calling anything live.
- What the game is and how it runs never change. What it does and how it looks are sliders on one performance budget (see `docs/desktop-photoreal-handoff.md`). Every feature and every detail is priced in measured ms and memory, next to what it adds. Costly, low-value things go to Nathan, not cut silently.
- Still waits for Nathan: anything touching sign-in, paid services, data loss, big downloads (the real county map data and its OpenStreetMap credit line), or deleting things.

## Waiting on Nathan

When a helper hits a wall it writes its question here and stops. That task waits, and the next task in the queue starts. Answer any time; the task picks up from the answer.

## Working now (background helpers, each in its own worktree and branch)

| Helper | Branch | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Town speed | `claude/town-speed` | 69k-person town: under 15 ms a step, no step over 100 ms, builds in under a minute |
| New drawing style | `claude/new-drawing-test` | 16k town drawn the new way, measured against today's 58 ms, 6.7 GB and 470/369 stutters |
| Trees that grow | `claude/trees-grow` | Queue 12 |
| Light through the day | `claude/daylight` | Ranked detail #8 |
| Region under load | `claude/region-load-fixes` | Big regions join; no city-line or server freezes |

In review: the crop calendar (PR #537, ranked detail #1).

Done and live: #535 (the region play-through joins again), #538 (shared-region stress test; findings in the scale-test doc), #536 (details ranked by impact).

## The queue, in order

A few helpers run at a time, never two on the same files.

*Running now:* 1 town speed, 2 shared region, 3 new drawing style measured.

*Make it smooth everywhere*
4. Drawing speed: building drawing cost and graphics memory (6.7 GB to under 2 GB).
5. Automatic quality levels for the browser, Mac mini and Mac Studio, each with a detail budget.
6. The detail-by-distance system (near, middle, far; fades in; built a little each frame).
7. A browser measurement: the web build timed in a real browser.
8. Long-haul test: hours at top speed, memory creep, autosave and big-edit freezes.
9. Shared-region stress test: several players with big towns.

*How it looks*
10. Houses grown in code (brick, siding, roofs, windows, trim), checked against real photos.
11. Shops, civic buildings and factories grown the same way.
12. Trees that grow (Grant County kinds, seasons, cheap far versions).
13. Ground surfaces: grass, soil, gravel, crop fields by season, roads that age, crack and get patched.
14. Ground wear and desire paths.
15. People's clothes and bodies from who they are (age, job, income, weather).
16. People's behavior up close: walking styles, groups, kids, dogs.
17. Cars and trucks: real detail up close, dirt, rust and salt by age and season.
18. Crowds and events up to 100,000: real fan behavior, players, referees, cheerleaders, band, camera crews, lights, scoreboard.
19. Night and light: porch lights, streetlights, stadium lights.
20. Closer zoom step 1: 40 m to 20 m on the desktop.
21. Closer zoom step 2: to 10 m, then standing on the sidewalk (no shirt buttons).

*Life you discover:* `docs/real-life-details.md`, now ranked by impact (Nathan, 2026-10-25: "organize that list by what we have the most dramatic impact on the game and work on those things first"). Work it from the Top 50 down, a few ideas a helper, numbers checked before they become rules.

*Waits for Nathan*
30. The real Grant County map from public data (big downloads; OpenStreetMap credit line).
31. Measuring on the Mac mini and Mac Studio themselves.

## Results so far

- `docs/scale-test-2026-10-25.md`: the measurements and the plan.
- Live today: #527 (desktop land preload), #528 (no construction-truck jam), #529 (house trucks), #530 (free builder's yard).
