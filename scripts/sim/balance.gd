## Every gameplay number in one place: money, prices, upkeep, taxes, grants,
## growth pace and yields. Tune the game here; the simulation scripts only
## read these values.
##
## Amounts are whole US dollars. One game day settles one month of budget,
## so "a month" below is one game day. Each value notes the real-world
## figure it follows, so a change can stay grounded in reality.

# --- Money -------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cash a new city starts with.
const START_MONEY := 3_000_000

## Difficulty, picked when a city starts: cash to start with, and how much
## income (taxes and water bills), upkeep (roads and services) and milestone
## grants are scaled. Normal is real prices; Easy and Hard bend the budget the
## way Cities: Skylines' hard mode does, without changing what things cost.
const DIFFICULTIES := {
	"easy": {"name": "Easy", "start": 5_000_000, "income": 1.25, "upkeep": 0.8, "grants": 1.5},

## Population milestones and the grant each one brings (like CS2's milestone
## rewards; in real life, state and federal community development grants).

# --- Roads -------------------------------------------------------------------

## Building a road: what the city pays, dollars per metre. A full new
## two-lane street costs about $1,000 a metre ($1.6M a mile, state DOT
## figures), but in US towns developers build most local streets and hand
## them to the city, and state and federal aid pays most of a highway. So the
## city's share is about a fifth (CS2 likewise prices a starter grid at a
## small slice of the opening funds).
## (Tuned 2026-10-22: at full price a starter street cost $16,000 a home and
## took five game years to pay back; CS2 pays back a first neighborhood in
## minutes.)

# --- Taxes and property ------------------------------------------------------
